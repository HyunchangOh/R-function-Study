# R Function Study
Made with contents from BiS335@KAIST, 2022 Fall, by Prof. Gwan-su Yi.

## Purpose
The R language is de facto lingua franca of statistics. 
This python program helps you a wide variety of R functions and their functionalities.
The function definition, or a guide on how to use those functions can be readily found by running the command "?" followed by the name of the function. 
Therefore, it is important to know which functions exist in R libraries and the functionalities they offer.

## Offers
The program offers random questions that asks the user to,
1) guess function name from function description (multiple-choice)
2) guess function description from function name (multiple-choice)

## How to Run
This program has been developed with Python 3.10.5, and tested in Windows 10 21H2 with the same version of Python.
At root directory, type the command 'python quiz.py'.

Depending on environment variables on the machines and possible conflicting versions of Python installed, you may have to run,
'python3 quiz.py' instead.
